# Hangman Game

This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game, created in Python. Players try to guess a randomly chosen word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.
Game Features

   - Word Selection: Randomly selects a word from a list of common terms.
   - Hangman Visualization: Displays the hangman ASCII art that updates as the player makes incorrect guesses.
   - Game Logic: Tracks guessed letters, prevents duplicate guesses, and ends the game when the word is guessed or when the player runs out of attempts.

How to Play

  - Run the game in a Python environment.
  - The game will prompt you to guess letters or the entire word.
  - Each incorrect guess decreases your remaining attempts, visually represented by the hangman stages.
  - The game ends when you guess the word or run out of tries.
